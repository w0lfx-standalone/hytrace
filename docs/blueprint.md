# **App Name**: Hytrace Marketplace

## Core Features:

- GHC Token Minting: Enable certified organizations to mint Green Hydrogen Credits (GHC) as ERC721 tokens representing MWh of green hydrogen produced, with details recorded on the blockchain.

- Transparent Marketplace: Facilitate the buying and selling of GHC tokens between producers and industry buyers, ensuring immutable ownership transfer via blockchain transactions.
- GHC Token Retirement: Allow buyers to retire GHC tokens to claim green benefits, permanently marking the token as used in the smart contract to prevent double counting.
- Auditing: Provide regulatory authorities with permissioned, read-only access to the ledger for real-time market monitoring and auditing.
- Role-Based Interface: Create dedicated interfaces tailored to different user roles (producers, buyers, regulators) for ease of use.
- AI-Powered Trend Analysis: Employ an AI tool to analyze GHC trading data and market trends to predict demand, identify inefficiencies, and recommend optimized trading strategies.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated teal (#46B1A2) to represent the green energy sector and innovation.
- Background color: Very light greenish gray (#F0F4F3). This provides a neutral, spacious background for the vibrant elements.
- Accent color: Coral (#FF7F50) to draw attention to key interactive elements and calls to action, suggesting forward movement and transition.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, for a balance of modernity and readability.
- Use detailed and dynamic icons related to green energy, blockchain, and finance to visually communicate key concepts.
- Employ a maximalist approach with layered elements, overlapping graphics, and bold typography to create a visually engaging and dynamic user experience.
- Incorporate fluid, interactive animations for data visualizations, transitions, and user feedback to enhance user engagement and understanding.
